      question: "What is fursuit photography?",
      answer: "Fursuit photography is a type of photography that specializes in capturing images of people wearing fursuits, which are costumes designed to look like anthropomorphic animals or creatures. Fursuit photography often takes place at conventions or events centered around anthropomorphic culture and is used to showcase the creativity and craftsmanship that goes into making fursuits."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of events do you attend as a fursuit photographer?",
      answer: "I (at least for the time being) attend only outings and private meetups. These events  for fursuiters allow them to wear their costumes and interact with others who share similar interests, and they also offer opportunities for photographers to capture images of fursuits in action, both individually and in group."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I book a photoshoot with you?",
      answer: "You can book a photoshoot just by sending me a message on Telegram. We can discuss all the details there."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring to the photoshoot?",
      answer: "Well, mainly you and your fursuit of course! And you probably shouldn't forget some water. Other things/details will be discussed individually."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the cost of your photography services?",
      answer: "The cost is for one suiter for one hour. Each additional suiter costs 100CZK. The details can be found on the Pricing page."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of post-production work do you offer?",
      answer: "I edit all of my photos in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, post-production is done in Adobe Photoshop and sharpening is done via Sharpen AI."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of equipment do you use for fursuit photography?",
      answer: "My camera is a Sony Alpha A7 II with a Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 lens."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to receive my photos after the photoshoot?",
      answer: "Your photos will be delivered within 14 days after the day of the photoshoot. If you want to have the photos delivered sooner, there's an rush editing option. That means your photos will be delivered within 48 hours! This option will cost you +20% of your initial price."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you accommodate group photoshoots?",
      answer: "Yes, for sure I can accommodate group photoshoots. The only limit would be if you can fit on one photo xP."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer outdoor photoshoots?",
      answer: "Yes, for sure. Expect most of my photoshoots to be outside. But I can rent a photostudio if needed. The rent will be added to your final price."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you do photoshoots in different locations?",
      answer: "Yes, but I don’t have a car, so ideally the location should be accessible by train/public transport. Other details can be discussed individually."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I receive my photos after the photoshoot?",
      answer: "Your photos will be delivered within 14 days of the photoshoot via Google Drive in a *.jpg format. Unedited (RAW) photos are stored for 1 month after the photoshoot. If you want to claim a complaint, you have to it within that 1-month period!"
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have a refund or cancellation policy?",
      answer: "Yes, I do. If you, as customer, cancel or reschedule the photoshoot, you have to do it with adequate advance – at least 3 days in advance. In other case, you’re not eligible for refund!"
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have any other questions?",
      answer: "If so, you can contact me on Telegram and ask me about it."
